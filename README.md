## WordPress AJAX Comments Plugin

*by Mike Smullin*


This is old source code I am rescuing from a dying backup drive.  
I decided to make it public now that it has sufficiently rotted and is no longer fit for any purpose.
Do not try to use it.

This software was developed by me in the year 2009.  
It was a paid plugin for WordPress.  
Marketed at $0.99 USD per license.  
Sold over 1,000+ copies.  
Included unlimited lifetime technical support until I realized it was totally not worth it for what I was charging.

Lesson learned: As soon as some people pay anything--even one penny--their buyers ego will drive them to abuse the seller to virtually no end, ultimately demanding refunds without any guilt at all.

Now it serves as a humorous portfolio piece, and a bit of nostalgia from WordPress glory days.
