Version 2.09, 2007-12-07
------------------------
- Completely rewrote to use WordPress Plugin API exclusively, facilitating the
  seamless integration with other WordPress components. Also eliminates the need
  for hacking during installation; just activate and it works.
- Switched JavaScript library to jQuery instead of Script.aculo.us.
- Bumped timeout to 60 seconds instead of 30.
- Switched AJAX spinner graphic to one that works against any color/pattern
  background.
- Provided id/class attributes for plugin-generated elements so CSS styles can
  be easily overridden.
- Added an Options > AJAX Comments page in the WordPress Administration Panel.
  - Added the choice between flexible vs. conventional performance:
    - Flexible: Recycles 100% of existing comment template markup to work
      with any theme.
    - Conventional: Recycles only the comment template markup for new comments;
      only works with themes that follow Kubrick's comment markup conventions.
- Improved error handling; now catches and queues all WordPress and PHP errors.
- Switched to user-friendly red boxes above the comment form when displaying
  error messages, instead of JavaScript alert boxes.
- Added support for localization of text strings.
- Tested for cross-browser compatibility on Windows XP Professional Edition SP2,
  verified to work in the following browsers:
  - Firefox 2.0.0.11
