CHANGES
-------

As of AJAX Comments 2.09 the installation is fully automatic. It is no longer
necessary to manually edit any of the template or WordPress core files.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

AJAX Comments requires a web server, PHP4 (4.3.3 or greater) or PHP5
(http://www.php.net/) and MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/). The Apache web
server and MySQL database are recommended; other web server and database
combinations such as IIS have been tested to a lesser extent. When using MySQL,
version 4.1 or greater is recommended.

For more detailed information about WordPress requirements, see "Server
requirements" (http://codex.wordpress.org/Hosting_WordPress#Server_requirements)
in the WordPress Codex.
